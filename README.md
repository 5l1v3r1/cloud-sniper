## *Cloud Security Operations*

### *What is Cloud Sniper?*

***Cloud Sniper*** is a platform designed to manage *Security Operations* in cloud environments. It is an open platform that allows responding to security incidents by analyzing and correlating native cloud artifacts. Cloud Sniper is to be used as a *Virtual Security Operations Center (vSOC)* to detect and remediate security incidents providing a complete visibility of the company's cloud security position.  

With this platform, you will have a complete and comprehensive management of the security incidents, reducing the costs of having many level-1 security analysts looking for cloud-based *Indicators of Compromise (IOC)*. These *IOCs*, if not correlated, generate difficulties in detecting complex attacks. At the same time, ***Cloud Sniper*** lets the advanced security analysts integrate the platform with external forensic or incident and response tools to provide security feeds into the platform.

The cloud-based platform is deployed automatically and provides complete and native integration with all the necessary information sources, avoiding the problem that many vendors have when deploying or collecting data.

***Cloud Sniper*** receives cloud-based and third-parties feeds and automatically responds protecting your infrastructure and generating a knowledge database of the *IOCs* that are affecting your platform. This is the best way to gain visibility in environments where information can be bounded by the *Shared Responsibility Model* enforced by cloud providers.

To detect advanced attack techniques, which may easily be ignored, the ***Cloud Sniper Analytics*** module correlates the events generating *IOCs*. These will give visibility on complex artifacts to analyze, helping both to stop the attack and to analyze the attacker's *TTPs*.

***Cloud Sniper*** is currently available for *AWS*, but it is to be extended to others cloud platforms.
